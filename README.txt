QuickGig - Static Frontend Prototype
-----------------------------------
This is a static, multi-page frontend for the QuickGig platform built with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- Uses localStorage for mock data (users, gigs, applications)
- No build tools required. Open index.html in a browser.

How to run:
1. Unzip the project.
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser.
3. Use the Register page to create accounts (choose role: student/client/admin).
4. The system stores data in localStorage. To reset, clear site data in browser or open console and run:
   localStorage.clear()
